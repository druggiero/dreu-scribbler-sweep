#sign reader class. picture should probably be taken outside of this class and passed in? pic is taken by robo
#must decide on implementation, this class will eventually be able to read the pink signs as well as find green signs for room exploration
#will handle everything to do with image processing. Needs lots of work but the functions it will use are mostly all written--ie, findSign and the getInFront
